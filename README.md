<h2>Hello there 👋</h2>

This page was designed to look good **on dark mode**, give it a try!

I’m a Front-end Developer, dedicated to creating high-quality web experiences and constantly learning about the latest technologies in web development.

My focus is on building apps with a strong focus on security and performance using React, Redux, TypeScript and JavaScript.

My experience includes ensuring smooth deployments with Jenkins and maintaining high code quality through Jest and Playwright.

⭐ My goal is pretty simple: build great things with great people. If we can work together to achieve that, <a href="mailto:ilie.ionut29@yahoo.com">I'd love to chat 👋 </a>
