<h2>Hello there 👋</h2>

This page was designed to look good **on dark mode**, try it!

I'm a newbie coder who is interested in a lot of things related to programming and STEM and who's got a lot of fingers in a lot of different pies. I would say that my end-goal is to be a machine learning/front-end specialist but at the moment -- this early in my career, I'm content with being a generalist to get the big picture of all things coding. A jack-of-all-trades, if you will.

👨‍💻 I'm currently working as a front end developer for a company in Bucharest & also working on my project portfolio to showcase my coding skills to potential employers and in the process of revamping my GitHub profile.
<br/>
📖 I’m also learning React and unrelated tech skills like SQL & Java
