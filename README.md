<h2>Hello there 👋</h2>

This page was designed to look good **on dark mode**, give it a try!

I'm a newbie coder who is interested in a lot of things related to programming & crypto world. I would say that my end goal is to be a front end specialist with some back end skills, but at the moment, this early in my career, I'm trying to learn as much as I can and working to my my project portfolio to showcase my coding skills to potential employers.

👨‍💻 I'm currently working as a front end developer for a company in Bucharest with JavaScript, ReactJS, PHP & Knockout.js technologies.
<br/>
📖 I’m also learning ReactJS and tech skills like SQL & Java and watching crypto news.
