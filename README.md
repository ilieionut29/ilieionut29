<h2>Hello there 👋</h2>

This page was designed to look good **on dark mode**, give it a try!

As I am still figuring out how my life is going to look in the future, I'm happy to say that I am a curious learner of all things. In addition to programming, football, and going to the gym, I like to build memorable experiences with great people.

I'm a newbie coder who is interested in a lot of things related to programming & crypto world. I would say that my end goal is to be a front end specialist with some back end skills, but at the moment, this early in my career, I'm trying to learn as much as I can and working to my project portfolio to showcase my coding skills to potential employers.

👨‍💻 So far, I've worked with various technologies, focusing mainly on React.js, Redux, Redux Saga, TypeScript and JavaScript.
<br/>
📖 Additionally, I've worked with automation tools like Jenkins to improve the deployment processes. For testing and ensuring code quality, I've mostly used Jest and Playwright.
<br/>
⭐ My goal is pretty simple: build great things with great people. If we can work together to achieve that, <a href="mailto:ilie.ionut29@yahoo.com">I'd love to chat 👋 </a>
